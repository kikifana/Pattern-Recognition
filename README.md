# Pattern-Recognition
## implemented with matlab or google colab using pytorch
- Project 3 : discriminant analysis,mahalanobis distance,bayes classifier
- Project 4 : linear discriminants - SVM
- Project 5 : clustering
- Project 6 : neural networks
- Final Project : classification with Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR-10 and classification on mask detection using custom dataset.
  Created a custom dataset with faces wearing masks or not and built a CNN for classification.
